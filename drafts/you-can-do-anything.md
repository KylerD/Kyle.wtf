A few years ago my old scrum team used to maintain a wall of quotes in the office, the rule was basically if somebody said something and it made the whole room laugh, it went up on the wall to be fondly remembered. This led to some out-of-context golden nuggets like "I was nearly Jesus, you know", "what does IT mean?" and my very own, "You can do anything, if you know what you're doing".

The origin of that quote was a total brain-fart during a pair-programming exercise with my friend, Kelly. We were working on a tricky bit of regex together when she asked "How did you know you could do that?", I was trying to say that regex is capable of fairly complicated pattern-matching if you know the syntax, but I was a little distracted in the code and what I said in the moment was "You can do anything, if you know what you're doing". Once the room had simmered down from laughing and roasting me for my choice of words, it was immortalised on a post-it note and stuck on the wall. 

Despite it's silly origins, that quote has stuck in my head now for years. I find myself remembering it any time I'm learning something new, especially if I feel a little overwhelmed and unsure of myself. It's ironically become a sort of motivational mantra for me. If I just push on, and learn more about whatever it is I'm doing, eventually I'll know what I'm doing.

Fast forward a few years to today, I've left my job at Kainos after 12-years to take on the role of Engineering Lead at Hamilton Robson. From designing and building big government-scale projects over a number of years and providing technical leadership to an account of over 150+ staff, to building smart-offices with LoRaWAN alongside a small team of energized engineers! 

And the plot thickens, I'm about to become a dad! Navigating this life-changing event alongside a career switch may seem like juggling flaming torches while balancing on a unicycle, but hey, remember the mantra, "You can do anything, if you know what you're doing".

So, to all of you out there facing your own flaming-torch, unicycle moments, I say: you've got this! Trust in your abilities, embrace the change and just remember, we can all do anything if we're open to learning and growing.

So, here's my two cents for anyone out there pondering a leap of faith - whether it's a career change, a new project, or a personal transition. Remember, you're capable of amazing things. It's about learning, adapting, and believing in your abilities to navigate through whatever comes your way.
