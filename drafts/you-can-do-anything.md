For over four years I worked on the Department for Transport [Street Manager](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/plan-and-manage-roadworks) service. Street Manager is a central hub used by every local highway authority, utility company, and contractor working for these organisations, to plan and manage street and road works across England. The service processes 2-3 million permit applications per year, supports over 500+ organisations and 10,000+ users. Street Manager is a transformative service that has been recognised by DfT as an exemplar digital delivery project and has been nominated for various industry awards including best use of new technology, cross-sector digital collaboration, digital leaders and more.

I started the project in 2018 as a Senior Software Engineer. After a few months I became a Lead Software Engineer for my team, then shortly after that Technical Architect, eventually becoming Lead Architect for the entire project. Thinking back to the time I spent on Street Manager, and the various hats I wore from ground-up development to high-level ownership, there were so many lessons learned and interesting challenges that my team and I had to overcome. I wanted to capture them here as a handy reference for myself, but I struggled to write about the various topics together. I think it's because there is too much stuff to talk about, from low level technical considerations to high level people and processes, it's hard to fit it all in one cohesive post.
